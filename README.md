# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
Now that we've added more filters for users to interact with, users will now be able to sort through data to find UFO sightings of similar criteria. For example, if someone wanted all of the UFO sightings in the US on 1/10/2010 they will get the following search results:

These filters will now allow users to create a variety of searches and produce a number of different filtered results.

## Summary
In conclusion, one drawback of this new design would be that there are still two filters that can be added to give a more detailed search to users. So my two recommendations to fix this issue would be to:

1. Add a filter for the duration time.
2. Add a filter for keys words that can be highlighted within the comments of each entry.
